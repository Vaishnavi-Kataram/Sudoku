# Sudoku

This project involves creating a Sudoku game using Python and Pygame, featuring a sophisticated implementation of the backtracking algorithm. The game includes additional functionalities such as a timer, pencil marking for players to check before making a final decision, and a strike count to penalize incorrect inputs.

Key Features:

Backtracking Algorithm: Implement a robust backtracking algorithm to generate and solve Sudoku puzzles, ensuring a challenging and solvable gaming experience.

Timer: Integrate a timer to track the duration of the player's Sudoku-solving journey, adding an element of competition and encouraging efficiency.

Pencil Marking: Provide players with the ability to make temporary pencil marks in each cell, allowing them to explore potential solutions before committing to a final choice.

Strike Count for Wrong Inputs: Implement a mechanism to keep track of incorrect entries made by the player, discouraging guessing and promoting logical reasoning.

Technologies Used:
- Python for the core logic and game mechanics
- Pygame for the graphical user interface and interactive gameplay elements
  
The Sudoku game with these advanced features aims to offer an engaging and challenging experience, catering to both casual players and Sudoku enthusiasts. The incorporation of a backtracking algorithm ensures the generation of valid puzzles, while the timer and additional features enhance the overall gaming experience.
